Topic (Idea):
A conversational AI (Chatbot) built with python and natural language processing models 
to address the COVID-19 pandemic problems faced by patients and doctors.

Detailed Description:

Basically this Chatbot idea solves two problems

1. Before the patients come to the hospital, let them take an appointment going to this 
website  - Let the Chatbot asks a question like - Why the patient is visiting? What symptoms 
does he have? Like cough, cold or fever? Basically this app will decide what patients have to 
be really tested with COVID-19 sample kit So this solves the problem of COVID-19 kits shortage 
going on right now.

2. To reduce the workload to the doctor, let Chatbot answer the patient queries instead of a Doctor 
for all repetitive questions. If Chatbot couldn't answer then let's give an option to a patient to go 
to Doctor or Wait for the doctor to answer your question.

The bot will take care of conversation and triggering messages automatically between hospital members. 
The chatbot can suggest the nearby clinics or hospitals that can be consulted and the timings when the 
doctor is available. Will modify the requirements as and when needed while developing the application.

Implementation:

There can be two ways to implement Chatbot:

1.Rule-based approach and 
2.Self-learning bots. 

We are planning to create self-learning bots that involve machine learning concepts since the Rule-based 
approach addresses only simple queries and fails to manage complex ones. We would like to decide the approach 
based on time. We are trying to avoid NLTK as much as possible since it has all pre-built methods and try to 
use Natural Language processing models like Language Models and Hidden Markov Principles. But we would like 
to keep as simple as possible.
